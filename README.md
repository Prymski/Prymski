- 👋 Hi, I’m @Prymski (or you can call me Andy!)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding, so that it can take me somewhere in life and I can work on my own projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, but then I will move on to Java to finish the web development trio. After that I will find a new language that I am interested in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my personal projects, possibly.
- 📫 How to reach me via Instagram (@andyfletcherr)
